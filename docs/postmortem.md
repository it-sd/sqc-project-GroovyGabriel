# Postmortem

### I initially had bigger plans for this project, but then I realized just how little I understood the material of this class and how overwhelmed I was. So, the main idea kinda fell apart. However, I still made something that launches using Render. 


### What went well:

#### It launches, I guess. I got text to show up. The color scheme went exactly how I planned. I have a basic understanding of GitHub and how it works, so that's good.


### What went poorly:

#### Pretty much everything else. I couldn't get the original idea of functionality to work. There's still so much I just don't understand regarding what was introduced in this class.


## Conclusion

### This project has felt very overwhelming overall. It felt very odd starting the final project on the second week of the course. I intend on eventually getting back to this and trying to make it work, but that is unfortunately not going to be happening in this last week. I would also just like to note that I did not have any pull request for the peer contribution, which is why none have been accepted.
