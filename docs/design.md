# Error Prevention
### In it's current state, my project does not work, and is not even close to working. This, of course, is an error. For the sake of error prevention, I would like my project to work. At least to some degree.

# Aesthetic and Minimalist Design
### I would like the site to look better. I would like some color, a better, more visually appealing site overall because at the moment it is not much to look at. I'm afraid of it feeling barren so I'll try to find things to fill some of the empty space.

# Color scheme
### I was thinking a nice, sleek, and sophisticated white with black letters for the color scheme. Not too flashy.
